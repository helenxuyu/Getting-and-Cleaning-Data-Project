There are four files in this repository. They are README.md, CodeBook.md, run_analysis.R and tidyData.txt. The CodeBook.md describes the procedures for the data cleaning. The run_analysis.R is the r code which perform the data cleaning. The tidyData is the final output with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
